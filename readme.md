Guides
======
Welcome to Visual Guides for Windows.  This program is designed to provide intractive guide lines over any programs in Windows to help you line things up and generally design better.

To get started, simply run Guides.exe.  
Middle-click anywhere on-screen to crate a guide there. 
Middle-click a guide again to remeove it.
Left-click on or near (within 6 pixels) the guide to drag it around.  Note that if you click on the guide itself, it will block the click from the program below.
Right-click to swap horizontal/vertical. 
Right-click-drag to rotate a guide freely.
Right-click a rotated guide in-place to return to vertical/horizontal orientation

Hold shift and use the mouse wheel to move horizontal or vertical guides.
Hold Alt while mouse-wheeling for more precise movement
Hold Ctrl while mouse-wheeling for coarse movement.

Alt + Ctrl + c will clear all guides
Alt + Ctrl + p will pause mouse input so you don't accidentally move or remove your guides.

You can exit the program from the tray icon it creates, or by using the icon on the taskbar.  If the window is focused (either click on the tray icon or click a guide) Alt+F4 will work too :)

Enjoy!

Note: Only works on main monitor for now
