Guides
======
Welcome to Visual Guides for Windows.  This program is designed to provide intractive guide lines over any programs in Windows to help you line things up and generally design better.

To get started, simply run Guides.exe. 
Mouse Input
===========
- Middle-click anywhere on-screen to crate a guide there. 
- Middle-click a guide again to remeove it.
- Left-click on or near (within 6 pixels) the guide to drag it around.  Note that if you click on the guide itself, it will block the click from the program below.  The cursor will change to a finger to let you know you this is the case.
- Right-click to swap horizontal/vertical. 
- Right-click-drag to rotate a guide freely.
- Right-click a rotated guide in-place to return to vertical/horizontal orientation

Mouse Wheel
===========
- Hold shift and use the mouse wheel to move horizontal or vertical guides.
- Hold Alt while mouse-wheeling for more precise movement
- Hold Ctrl while mouse-wheeling for coarse movement.

Mouse Input
===========
- Alt + Ctrl + c will clear all guides
- Alt + Ctrl + p will pause mouse input so you don't accidentally move or remove your guides.
- Alt + Ctrl + h will toggle show/hide the guides.
- Alt + Ctrl + q will quit the app.

You can exit the program from the tray icon it creates, or by using the icon on the taskbar.  If the window is focused (either click on the tray icon or click a guide) Alt+F4 will work too :)

Enjoy!

Note: Only works on main monitor for now
