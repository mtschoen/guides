Guides
======
Welcome to Visual Guides for Windows.  This program is designed to provide intractive guide lines over any programs in Windows to help you line things up and generally design better.

After you run the program, middle-click anywhere on-screen to crate a guide there. Left-click on or near (within 6 pixels) the guide to drag it around.  Right-click to swap horizontal/vertical.  Middle-click the guide again to remeove it.

Alt + Ctrl + c will clear all guides
Alt + Ctrl + p will pause mouse input so you don't accidentally move or remove your guides.

You can exit the program from the tray icon it creates, or by using the icon on the taskbar.

Enjoy!

Note: Only works on main monitor for now
